# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT  - DUAL CHASE //
![Image description](SG.png)

Welcome to my Portfolio Website.

As part of my assignment, I was tasked with developing a portfolio website to showcase my skills, including programming, music production, and audio engineering. Since I create beats and songs for public enjoyment, this project allowed me to demonstrate my dedication and expertise. I aimed to build a clean yet effective website with responsive pages tailored to my primary audience—consumers interested in purchasing my beats.

The website’s structure includes a primary index page with minimal details leading to my portfolio, where visitors can access a media player to listen to my beats and explore my work. In my reference list, I credited an individual who inspired the design of my media player, acknowledging their influence on this feature. Creating my media player has been a long-standing interest of mine, and I’m thrilled with the outcome. My goal was to deliver a straightforward yet distinctive design that reflects my unique style.

Challenges and Solutions

While developing the website, I encountered several challenges. One significant issue involved the media player, where the beat selection functionality was hidden, making it difficult for users to choose tracks. To address this, I ensured that users could enjoy uninterrupted playback of the entire playlist until the issue is fully resolved.

Additionally, I utilized autocorrect tools to address initial errors on the homepage and later used the W3C Validator to thoroughly review my code. This process uncovered issues I hadn’t noticed before, which I successfully corrected, improving the website's overall performance and reliability.

================================================================================

Common Errors Encountered
CSS Errors – Issues with styling elements.
Media Player Bugs – Beat selection functionality was hidden.
Image Naming Errors – Incorrect or inconsistent file naming.
GitHub Merging Errors – Challenges during branch merging.
Merging to Master – Additional complexities when integrating updates into the main branch.
Through persistence and problem-solving, I’ve refined my portfolio into a functional and engaging platform, aligning with both my technical goals and artistic vision.
